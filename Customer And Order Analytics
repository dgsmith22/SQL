# This SQL involves the use of common DML queries in order to quantify statistical insights about about customer and order data from a database with multiple tables.

# 1. How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT count(orderID) AS Number_Of_Orders 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales

# 2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT  Product, count(orderID) AS Number_Of_Orders 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE Product = "iPhone"

# 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT customers.acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers 
INNER JOIN FebSales 
ON customers.order_id = Febsales.orderID

# 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

SELECT distinct Product, MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY Product, price 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1

# 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM (Quantity) * price AS Revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY Product

# 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM (Quantity), product, SUM(Quantity) * price AS Total_Revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101' 
ORDER BY product

# 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(Cust.acctnum) AS Number_Of_Customers, AVG(Quantity*price) AS Average_Amount_Spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS Cust
ON Feb.orderId = Cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
